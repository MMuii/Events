# Events
App made mostly to practise MERN stack. It allows you to create, moderate and join events.

## Features
- two availability modes - events can be public or private
- live comments system - comments are being updated in real time, so app can be used, for example, during conferences
- moderating comments - each comment has to be approved by event's organizer before it shows to participants
- pinning comments - event's organizer can pin comment, so it displays at the top of comments list
- invitation links - each event has it's unique invitation ID which can be shared to invite more participants. Invitation links are the only way users can find and join private events.
